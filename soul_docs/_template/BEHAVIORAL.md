## STAR Method Deep Dive

**S - Situation:**
- Set the context (when, where, who)
- Keep it brief (1-2 sentences)
- Make it specific

**T - Task:**
- What was the challenge or goal?
- What was YOUR role specifically?
- Why did it matter?

**A - Action:**
- What did YOU do? (This is the longest part)
- Be specific about your actions
- Show your thought process
- Include challenges you faced

**R - Result:**
- What was the outcome?
- Use metrics when possible
- Include what you learned
- Connect to company values

**Example:**
```
S: "In my role as a backend engineer, our API response times
   increased from 100ms to 2 seconds over a two-week period."

T: "I needed to identify and fix the performance issue before it
   impacted our SLA with key customers."

A: "First, I added detailed logging to identify bottlenecks.
   I discovered a new feature had introduced an N+1 query problem.
   I refactored the code to use batch queries and added automated
   performance tests to catch similar issues. I also set up alerts
   for response time degradation."

R: "Response times dropped back to 80ms, even better than before.
   The performance tests caught two more issues during code review.
   Most importantly, I documented the debugging process for the team,
   which helped us prevent similar issues in the future. I learned
   the importance of performance monitoring from day one of a feature."
```
