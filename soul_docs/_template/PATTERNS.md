- For senior+ roles
- Integration with coding problems

**Bit Manipulation**
- Frequency
- Typical difficulty

**Math & Logic**
- Problem types
- Expected knowledge

## Difficulty Distribution

Provide expected difficulty breakdown:
- **Easy:** XX% - Basic implementation, single concept
- **Medium:** XX% - Multi-concept, algorithmic thinking required
- **Hard:** XX% - Complex algorithms, optimization crucial

## Interview Format

### Time Allocation
- Typical problem solving time: XX minutes
- Number of problems per interview: X-X
- Time for questions: XX minutes

### Interview Structure
1. Introductions (X minutes)
2. Problem presentation (X minutes)
3. Clarification & examples (X minutes)
4. Coding (XX minutes)
5. Testing & optimization (X minutes)
6. Questions (X minutes)

### Environment
- Preferred language(s): [List or "Any standard language"]
- IDE/Editor: [CoderPad, Google Docs, proprietary system, etc.]
- Allowed resources: [None, documentation, calculator, etc.]

## Problem-Solving Approach They Value

**Communication:**
- How much talking through the problem is expected
- Should you ask clarifying questions?
- Importance of explaining your thinking

**Code Quality:**
- How much they care about clean code vs working solution
- Naming conventions importance
- Commenting expectations

**Optimization:**
- Is optimal solution required or nice-to-have?
- Time vs space tradeoff preferences
- How important is Big-O analysis?

**Testing:**
- Should you walk through test cases?
- How important is edge case handling?
- Do they expect you to debug live?

## Company-Specific Patterns

### Unique Characteristics
- Any unique problem styles or quirks
- Common twists on standard problems
- Areas of emphasis that differ from other companies

### Real-World Context
- Do they frame problems in business context?
- Use of realistic scenarios vs abstract problems
- Domain-specific knowledge required (if any)

### Follow-Up Questions
- Are follow-ups common?
- Typical follow-up patterns (optimization, extension, related problem)

## Category Breakdown by Role Level
